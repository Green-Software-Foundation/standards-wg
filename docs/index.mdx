### How we work

- We hold weekly meetings on Thursdays @1630 (BST) you can view [our minutes here](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/standards-wg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAgenda%2FMinutes).
- To make a proposal for a change in one of our standards, start a thread on the [discussions page](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/standards-wg/discussions/landing).
- Once the thread has gained some momentum with comments, ideas, and inputs from the rest of the group, convert it to an issue through the option on the right-hand side menu.
- Once the issue has sufficient material and agreement from the group on it, create a pull request linking that issue.
- Pull requests are reviewed by the group and if there is consensus merged during our weekly calls.

### Proposing a new project

- To propose a project, we ask that you create a short project document and gather the interest of at least three people from 2 different member organizations.
- Reach out to the chairs, who will add you to the next working group meeting agenda.
- If the working group reaches consensus and agrees, your project will be made official and start receiving the support of the Foundation.
- However, often it requires several conversations with the working group to evolve your project proposal to a version where everyone is comfortable.
- Once launched, the working group will support you in executing your project and source the resources required from the Foundation and its members.
