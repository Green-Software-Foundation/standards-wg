- Once the thread has gained some momentum with comments, ideas, and inputs from the rest of the group, convert it to an issue through the option on the right-hand side menu.
- Once the issue has sufficient material and agreement from the group on it, create a pull request linking that issue.
- Pull requests are reviewed by the group and if there is consensus merged during our weekly calls.
