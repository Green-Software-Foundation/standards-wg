Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct 
all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. 
It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities

described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy.

## Project Submission

[SCI to Foundation AI Models](c) 

> Dr. Ziliang Zong – Texas State University

Ziliang begins the discussion by reviewing the SCI to Foundation AI Model - 
Scope - Foundation models (e.g. BERT and BET-3) refer to large scale AI models that are trained on massive amount of data and can be adapted to a wide range of tasks (e.g. language, vision, human interaction etc.). Although foundation models are very powerful, they are extremely resource hungry with significant carbon emissions because of their scale. This project aims to create a comprehensive case study on evaluating the impact of foundation AI models on environment by applying the Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification. 

Abhishek - Dropped in a link to discuss if there is something that we can do in partnership with these folks (http://ai-carbon-efficiency-observatory.ai-for-sdgs.academy/) in relation to this project proposal. Abhishek also indicated that he's happy to provide guidance on choosing AI domains along with their output evaluations as well
Here is the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258
