## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct 
all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. 
It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities 
that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are 
described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. 
If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, 
feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.
  
## Agenda Approval (decision) 
2022.02.10 Agenda

> Sean reviews the Agenda - Asim motions to approve the agenda - No objections - Agenda approved
  
## Approval of previous meeting minutes
[2022.02.03_Minutes](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/standards_wg/blob/main/Agenda_Minutes/2022.02.03_minutes.md)

> Srini motions to approve the agenda - no objections - Minutes approved

## Approval of Project Proposal

> Dr. Ziliang Zong – Texas State University

[SCI to Foundation AI Models](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bcRAyN9ZxVKNf1GkaIbDJXnxvIo7Goe/edit)

> https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/standards_wg/issues/4

Henry requested if Ziliang was willing to have deep collaboration on framing and reviewing the project -- Would you accept an as yet undetermined group to talk regularly? They will provide live ongoing feedback instead of just at the deliverables.

Ziliang was unavailable, so it was agreed to review this at the next meeting

> WG has agreed to defer the approval of the project until the next WG meeting


## Review Open Issues and Discussions (Tagged High) (Discussion)

> Henry to lead

1. [Case study proposal - Ecommerce web application using eShoponWeb #227](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/issues/227)

Srini starts the discussion by reviewing the submitted comments

Asim suggested that networking technology consumes data no matter what, for example the network card consumes electricity no matter what. Different networks types have different emissions? Cell vs. WIFI network, and bias action to one. Chris added that it is possible to reduce the energy of networking equipment and In a cloud environment, he suggested the network usage is constant - but that then relates to waking/sleeping containers, etc

Asim suggested that networking technology consumes data no matter what, for example the network card consumes electricity no matter what. 
Chris added quoted 3.2 from [Reducing Network Energy](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/nsdi08/tech/full_papers/nedevschi/nedevschi_html/index.html) - “for interfaces that support wake-on-arrival, one approach to exploiting sleep states is that of opportunistic sleeping in which link interfaces sleep when idle - i.e.,a router is awakened by an incoming (dummy) packet and, after forwarding it on, returns to sleep if no subsequent packet arrives for some time, that it is possible to reduce the energy of networking equipment and In a cloud environment, I imagine network usage is constant - but that then relates to waking/sleeping containers, etc

Gadhu dropped into the chat a discussion around [IOWN](https://www.rd.ntt/e/iown/)(Innovative Optical and Wireless Network) that is an initiative for networks and information processing infrastructure including terminals that can provide high-speed, high-capacity communication utilizing innovative technology focused on optics, as well as tremendous computational resources. NTT research project is to reduce energy consumption of networking equipment. is this number important? Is the energy use/emissions of networking energy significant compared to CPUs? Is it like RAM and inconsequential?

- biggest network providers researching.
- Electronics to photonics, reduces energy use by 100x goal
- moving from light in wires, to light in datacentres

Srini suggested data is a part of delivering product. Network traffic is tracked.
Asim added the network emissions is a hot topic of conversation. Shift institute number provided a few years ago. Hotly contested, claims too high, but no one has presented another number.

Navveen dropped into the chat https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/methodology and indicated this takes in account networking and memory usage, might be a useful resource

### Discussions for review

[Discussions tab](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/discussions)

1. [Investigate a software procurement standard #233](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/discussions/233)

Henry - I think a developer tool is very different than a comparative tool (for IT decisions makers). You've highlighted some interesting questions, but I think one of the largest struggles will be ensuring a consistent boundary between different scores so that they are comparable.
Are we going to Setout rules for how to assess the carbon commitments of different organizations? Is there a third-party resource we can reference that is comprehensive? https://newclimate.org/2022/02/07/press-release-corporate-climate-responsibility-monitor-2022/

Gadhu: people procuring have different priorities than engineers. SCI is very useful for engineers. Procurement decisions are different.

Asim: people looking for simple advice, do they have a SCI score, have they trained

Chris added, he liked the SCI - and I can see a related standard being able to tie a procurement score to an SCI score. Maybe building a score bottom-up. I thought that could relate to the reporting project - ultimately becoming a competitive differentiator, picking the product with the lowest reported score. Below that, you already have GRI scores: https://www.globalreporting.org/standards/media/2458/gri_standards_brochure.pdf

Chris added, procurement decisions are available, would use scores to make decisions, the SCI is too granular for current decision making at the procurement level

Henry added that the SCI score is currently not useful for apples-to-apples comparison. Mitigation/offsets are important, but not part of the score but corporate responsibility is important: https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/cta-success-factors-measurements-and-driving-the-right-behaviour

A much simpler mechanism for making procurement decisions?
- set of questions/checklists that you should be asking
- GSF takes a position to drive behaviour?
- This becomes a useful tool for people procuring things, could be added to an RFP

> Working Group Action Item - come up with potential set of questions that should be asked as part of procurement. Maybe turn into specification/standard/model RFP language.

**Case study update/potentials:**
- Shell (Adam) strong interest
- Goldman Sachs (Sarah) -infrastructure
- Accenture (Navveen) - identifying case study

**Case studies added**
Vodafone (Asim) - might be interested
Avanade (Chris) - two interested parties, waiting for approval to share names
