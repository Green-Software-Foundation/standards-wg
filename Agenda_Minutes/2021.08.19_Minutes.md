## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct 
all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. 
It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities 
that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are 
described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. 
If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, 
feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

## SCI Problem Definition
> Asim Hussain

Asim leads the discussion by reviewing the [SCI Problem Definition](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1__0giL3F290uloRzUIJY2iT7Shpc-0QyQVxveCTf6ds/edit#slide=id.p)<br>
*GHG Protocol doesn’t work for software*<br>
*Scope 1 - Carbon from stuff you burned*<br>
*Scope 2 - Carbon from electricity you bought*<br>
*Scope 3 - Carbon from everything else in the production and use of your product.*<br>
*Carbon-neutral, net-zero all of these terms are just talking about scope 1 and 2. You can measure your scope 3 but you don’t need to do anything about it.*<br>
*Organisational boundaries, Amazons carbon calculation shouldn’t include any of Microsoft's carbon calculation.*<br>

Decisions - Reach consensus on 1.0: <br>
*Problem definition* <br>
*Characteristics* <br>
*Software boundaries* <br>
*Requirements and constraints of the equation components (E, M, I, R)* <br>
*For each choice, run it through the rubric and make sure it works conceptually for different application domains.* <br>

- Henry - We don't know what 'R' is but we have suggestions. Asim, proposed 'R' should be money
- Will - That's the business driver but i think $ is far more arbitrary and variable that enery e.g. inflation 
- Sarah - Will there be scenarios that carbon or any carbon-proxy data is not available? Are there other types of dat points we can consider if we run into those scenarios.
