## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct 
all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. 
It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities 
that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are 
described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. 
If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, 
feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

### Discussions for review

[Discussions tab](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/discussions)

- [SCI feedback from greeNsort #248](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/discussions/248)

WG: This conversation is more focused on algorithms. The SCI is more focused on measuring the impact of comprehensive software.
If you are sure you don't have control over some of the other non-algorithm specific hardware, use consistent assumptions/values across those variables. This is especially true when comparing different algorithms.

Challenge: many developers don't know things about their software (for example, what hardware the future software will run on). Does the WG have a position on what should be done in that situation.
-WG could provide what those default assumptions are
-Provide a range of potential options (onsite, hyperscale data center, local desktop/laptop)
-allow to make reasonable assumption about energy consumption and embodied carbon
-could be load tested hardware or a reasonable global assumption, or based on targeted client. In all cases, must remain the same between situations.
-Request: some guardrails that begin to answer these questions. Can we request from Open Data team?

> Comment for submitter - we would love to have you join the working group to discuss this in more depth. Very interesting question. It would be great to talk through the specific situation you find yourself in. 

**AI:** Gadhu will reach out to coordinate.
