## Antitrust Policy
Linux Foundation meetings involve participation by industry competitors, and it is the intention of the Linux Foundation to conduct 
all of its activities in accordance with applicable antitrust and competition laws. 
It is therefore extremely important that attendees adhere to meeting agendas, and be aware of, and not participate in, any activities 
that are prohibited under applicable US state, federal or foreign antitrust and competition laws.

Examples of types of actions that are prohibited at Linux Foundation meetings and in connection with Linux Foundation activities are 
described in the Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy. 
If you have questions about these matters, please contact your company counsel, or if you are a member of the Linux Foundation, 
feel free to contact Andrew Updegrove of the firm of Gesmer Updegrove LLP, which provides legal counsel to the Linux Foundation.

## SCI Review

Reminder - The WG has agreed to send the SCI for V1.0 approval at the start of Sept

[SCI Submitted issues](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/issues)

1. [Adding "End user Devices" to the list of "Supporting infrastructure and systems MAY include" in the Software Boundary section](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/issues/267)

WG Discussion<br>
Asim: are there other terms that encompass other types of devices? (Televisions, laptops, iot, EVs, edge devices)<br>
Pindy: Standard term?<br>
Henry: standard term, define in definitions?<br>

> AI: Benjamin assigned to create a PR

2. [Taking into account energy consumption of ancillary equipment into the SCI score](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/issues/266)

WG Discussion on proposed language<br>

"If your boundary includes on-premise and/or cloud data center operation, E should take into account the efficiency of the data center, including cooling and other energy consumption necessary to operate a data center. This is often described as Power Use Efficiency (PUE)."

> AI: Gadhu, to create a PR to add the proposed language into the SCI

3. [Quantification method -Guidance regarding methodology recommended for usage energy calculations - Specifications 1.0](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/software_carbon_intensity/issues/264)

Ziliang: instrumentation to measure supercomputers in high performance computation. Strict measurement requirements to make data center energy consumption more comparable. More heterogenous devices we are dealing with, so less ability to be strict. More relaxed at this point. We could propose a model.<br>
Asim: agree to keep loose to begin with. Spec shouldn't tell you how, but GSF should help you figure out how to calculate it.<br>
Srini: In case study, quantification/calculation methodology is explicitly explained. Had to explain approach to people asking.<br>

Consensus: Spec not include strict energy calculation guidance, but GSF ancillary documents should help you figure out how to calculate this. No PR at this time.
